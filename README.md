## Overview 
jQuery Calx is simple jQuery plugin for building javascript based calculation form. This is the initial release, so there is still lack of features and still changed recently. In the core of jQuery Calx, it uses standard calculator jison parser

[http://zaach.github.com/jison/try/](http://zaach.github.com/jison/try/) which is generated using standard jison calculator grammar. But you can extend the parser to use your own parser (this feature still in dev)
